    <h1>Hi I'm James and I aspire to become a web developer!</h1>
    <p><br>I am new to web development since I major in Networks but coding and websites has always fascinated me!<br>
           I am currently working as a junior tech personnel in a certain company and at the same time as a delegate in an online.<br>
           I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for helping me come this far! Thank you for the good people, the opportunities, the shelter and the mindset!<br>
    </p>
    <p><br>I have decided to maximize my time by creating personal projects in order to increase my credibility in this field. <br>
           This will be my first draft and I'm still looking for a constant time to work on project like this as my present schedule is pretty tight. <br>
           I aim to present an excellent portfolio page so that I can apply the knowledge and experience in my current work. <br>
           Feel free to contact me with your suggestions as I am very open and would love to hear from other programmers as well<br>
           <br>
           <br>
           Sincerely,<br>
           James Darrel Bautista
